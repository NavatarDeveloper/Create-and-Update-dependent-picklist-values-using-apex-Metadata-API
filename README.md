Create and Update dependent picklist values using apex Metadata API

# Scenario: - 
We need to create dependent picklist between 2 picklists into Salesforce Org, you all might be thinking that you do not need to write apex and it can be done using out of functionality but in my case, we have more than 1K values in both picklists and can be added/removed in future in short dynamic dependent picklist. In final we have to create 4 dependent picklists on the different objects.
